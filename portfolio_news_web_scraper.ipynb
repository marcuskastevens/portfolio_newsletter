      "Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Teladoc is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.\n",

      "By Kannaki DekaJan 26 (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co on Thursday warned of a loss in the current quarter, as passengers shunned the carrier in the immediate aftermath of a tech meltdown that forced it to scrap thousands of flights between Christmas and New Year's Eve.The forecast heaps more pain on the largest U.S. domestic carrier, which is facing regulatory scrutiny over its flight scheduling and handling of over 16,700 cancellations that disrupted holiday plans for tens of thousands of passengers.Southwest, which also reported a loss in the fourth quarter, said it expects a revenue hit of between $300 million and $350 million in the first quarter.\n",
      "But current booking trends for March were encouraging, it added.Operating revenue for the March quarter, when travel demand tends to slow, is expected to rise 20% to 24% year-over-year.The company's under-fire chief executive, Bob Jordan, on Thursday once again apologized for the mass cancellations, which were attributed to Southwest's outdated crew scheduling software.The software buckled under the weight of reassignments that had to be done after a severe winter weather left the carrier's crew stranded all over the country.The company is \"reexamining the priority of technology and other investments planned in 2023,\" Jordan said in a statement.Meanwhile, Southwest reported an adjusted loss of $226 million in the quarter through December, at a time when other major U.S. airlines such as United Airlines Holdings Inc and Delta Air Lines Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on strong travel demand.On a per share basis, Southwest's adjusted loss was 38 cents.\n",

      "Hauenstein also noted that advance bookings were \"significantly ahead on both yield and load factor\" for the quarter ended March 31 compared to the same period in 2019.There may well be a slowdown coming, but it certainly isn't being seen in Delta's data yet, and there's still ample room to grow by catching up to 2019.The cost pressures alluded to earlier will seep into 2023, with management expecting its nonfuel cost per available seat mile (CASM) to increase by 3% to 4% year over year in the first quarter.\n",
      "For reference, the average operating margin from 2015 to 2019 was 14.5%.With a labor agreement reached \"in principle\" with pilots, Delta should be over the worst of its labor cost issues, and as the airline builds scale (more departures and ASM), the CASM should decline.Delta Air Lines has an opportunity to grow revenue, grow margin, and benefit from a return of the higher-margin corporate traveler.\n",

      "The company's da Vinci robotic surgical suites have been on the market for more than 21 years, and between sales of the robots themselves, maintenance contracts, replacement parts, accessories like new surgical tools, and consumables, it brought in more than $1.3 billion in trailing-12-month net income, up from a mere $660 million in 2017.Via steady investment in research and development (R&D), the company continuously churns out new products in the form of robotic toolhead attachments, imaging systems, and software packages for use with its robots.Demand for procedures performed with the da Vinci is expected to continue growing by between 12% and 16% in 2023, which is roughly in line with growth in each of the past four years.But after the company missed Wall Street's Q4 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by $0.02 on Jan. 24, shareholders fear its growth might be slowing.The fact that it placed 4% fewer da Vinci units in the fourth quarter compared to the year prior is troubling as it could portend a more sustained deceleration of installations, which would in turn mean less recurring revenue from sales of consumables down the line.Plus, the total return of its stock has slightly underperformed the market over the last three years, rising by only 24.1% compared to the market's gain of 27.8%.Management points to a few headwinds that have been mucking up the works in that period, some of which are surprisingly sticky.\n",
      "While it's true that numerous competitors are making their way into the robotic surgery space, including powerful players like Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, the company's top-line growth has so far continued to plod forward, with an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% from 2019 to 2022.Plus, once Intuitive Surgical's robots are installed in an operating room, they'll continue to yield revenue for years because of how inconvenient it would be to switch to another system made by a competitor.\n",

      "During the Cold War, Soviet defectors admitted to using intelligence agents to infiltrate American and British semiconductor companies in an effort to steal technology.After the fall of the Iron Curtain, covert trade in Western technology continued though concerns shifted towards Chinese technology theft.However, the war in Ukraine and tensions between the West and China have elevated the issue from a commercial concern to a strategic threat.Illicit black market trading and smuggling, where semiconductors are transferred or stolen in breach of sanctions, sits alongside a well-established “grey market” for chips, where resellers trade semiconductors into third countries without the permission of the manufacturer, or use them in alternative applications in breach of contract.Getting an accurate value for these illicit markets is difficult, but between the black market and counterfeit chips, it is estimated to cost the industry billions of pounds each year.Experts compare the problem to the trade of conflict diamonds in West Africa during the 1990s.“It starts off with pure economic reasons, unofficial channels selling diamonds or other luxury goods cheaper than official channels,” says Black.\n",
      "It has long been part of Russia’s plans.”Last year a woman was arrested while travelling from Macau to China with a fake baby bump allegedly containing more than 200 semiconductor chips, Bloomberg reported, in one of the most eye-catching examples of the underground trade.As well as black market dealings, there is the “grey market”: semiconductor companies may sell microchips or technology to resellers in good faith, before they are moved and shifted through a web of shell companies and traders in jurisdictions with little oversight, rather than used as stated in their contracts.In its study of Russia’s illicit semiconductor supply chain, Rusi found components were often moved to trading hubs such as Hong Kong, before being taken on by Chinese resellers and transferred into Russia.“Procurement agents may set up front companies in Hong Kong or Malaysia, and then transship them to Russia,” says Byrne.Black says there are ways the industry can try to tackle the illicit chip trade.\n",
      "Chip stocks, also commonly referred to as semiconductor stocks, have quickly become some of the more popular investments within the market.After all, it’s easy to understand why, as chips are found within nearly every daily aspect of our lives, ranging from computers to freezers.And as we’re all aware, chip stocks had a rough showing in 2022, with oversupply and other macroeconomic forces working against them.However, perhaps to the surprise of some, a few chip stocks reward their shareholders with dividends, providing a nice cushion against the impact of drawdowns.Three chip stocks – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, Texas Instruments Inc.

      "Chip stocks, also commonly referred to as semiconductor stocks, have quickly become some of the more popular investments within the market.After all, it’s easy to understand why, as chips are found within nearly every daily aspect of our lives, ranging from computers to freezers.And as we’re all aware, chip stocks had a rough showing in 2022, with oversupply and other macroeconomic forces working against them.However, perhaps to the surprise of some, a few chip stocks reward their shareholders with dividends, providing a nice cushion against the impact of drawdowns.Three chip stocks – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, and Broadcom Inc. AVGO – all have a shareholder-friendly nature, rewarding investors with a dividend.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer glance at each one.Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world’s largest circuit foundry.\n",

      "In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.TSMC is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.\n",
