The stock price of Fiserv (FISV) is likely to be impacted by several factors in the future. One important factor to consider is the company's relative price strength, as identified by IBD's unique rating system with a score of 1 to 99. A recent upgrade in the Relative Strength Rating for Fiserv suggests that the company's technical performance is improving, which could be a positive indicator for its stock price.

Another important factor to consider is the company's partnerships and collaborations. Fiserv has recently joined forces with BNY Mellon to deliver additional capabilities for real-time foreign exchange (FX) rate quotes for payments from U.S. financial institutions. This partnership could potentially bring significant benefits for Fiserv and positively impact its stock price.

Fiserv's industry recognition and reputation is also an important factor to consider. The company is a member of the S&P 500® Index, the FORTUNE® 500, and has been recognized as one of FORTUNE World's Most Admired Companies® for 11 of the past 14 years and named among the World's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company for two consecutive years. This recognition could help to boost investor confidence and contribute to a positive stock price.

However, it's important to note that the overall market conditions and economic performance will also impact the stock price of Fiserv. For example, if the economy is in recession, investors may be more cautious and less likely to invest in the stock market. Additionally, the performance of other companies in the same industry, such as chipmaker Intel, may also have an effect on Fiserv's stock price.

In summary, the stock price of Fiserv is likely to be impacted by a combination of factors including the company's relative price strength, partnerships and collaborations, industry recognition and reputation, and overall market conditions and economic performance. It's important to keep an eye on these factors to get a better understanding of how they may impact Fiserv's stock price in the future.
