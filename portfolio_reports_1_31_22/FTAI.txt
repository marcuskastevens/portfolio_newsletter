FTAI Aviation Ltd. (NASDAQ:FTAI) is a publicly traded aviation leasing and aerospace products company. The company has a market capitalization of $2.228 billion and is expanding its reach in the aircraft engine service business. The company recently completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of iAero Thrust, a hospital maintenance and testing facility for CFM56 engines based in Miami, which will be rebranded as QuickTurn Engine Center.

The company has promising trends in terms of return on capital employed (ROCE) which is a measure of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. However, there are also some risks associated with investing in the company. A 15% decrease in stock price in 2023 and the warning signs of lower returns on equity, when compared to other companies like Nucor, Southern and Union Pacific.

In terms of future outlook, it's important to note that the stock market is currently in a bearish trend, which means that the company's shares may fall more than the rest of the market. However, some analysts believe that the company is set up for strong continued success, and that it could take a small, but relatively meaningful, share over time. It's also worth considering the recent acquisition of iAero Thrust and how it will impact the company's future growth prospects.

Additionally, investors should also consider the current economic conditions, such as the Federal Reserve's first meeting of the year, the monthly jobs report for January, and the recent release of earnings from Big Tech companies, which may impact the stock market and in turn, the stock price of FTAI Aviation.
