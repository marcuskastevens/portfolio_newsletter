Annual Earnings Forecast to Decline:
Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years. This presents a potential threat to TSM's stock price in the future.

Expensive Based on P/E Ratio and Estimated Fair Value:
TSM is currently expensive based on its P/E ratio and estimated fair value. This could make it difficult for the stock to see significant price appreciation in the short-term.

Dividend Yield:
TSM's dividend yield is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market. This could be a negative factor for income-focused investors.
